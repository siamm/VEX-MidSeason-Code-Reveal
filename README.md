This is our Driver Code and Competition Template as of before December (Mid-Season).
Parts of the code will be gone through over the VEX forums post.

This will almost definitely not be our code for World VEX. We are going to improve the code
or, if necessary, completely not use Take Back Half and use another velocity control for
our flywheel (Yes, we use a flywheel). But for now Take Back Half works fine.

If you have any enquires, please PM siam on the VEX forums. Thanks!
